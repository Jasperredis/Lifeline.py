# Lifeline.py 1.0
This is a guide to playing and interacting with Lifeline.py, version 1.0!  
Note that this **IS** a stable release, yet it does not have all of the features originally intended for this game.

# Title Screen
* **Start:** Starts a game. Kind of obvious.
* **Options:** The options. Again, kind of obvious. Below is a list of them:
  * *Background:* Changes the background colour.
  * *More coming soon!*
* **Updates:** Takes the GitHub repository for the website and fetches update data. **Basically, tells you info about the latest version, and provides a link to update if you're not running the latest.**
* **Difficulty:** Changes the difficulty. **Note that as of right now in 1.0, the optimal gameplay is only in the default, Normal, or the yellow heart.**

# Gameplay
* **Bar:** Lifeline.py's gameplay takes place on a bar. This bar is at dead centre of the screen.
* **Player:** You, the player, are a white line on the bar. You can move with the A and D keys, and mouse-controlled movement is going to be added in future updates.
* **Life:** You have a life counter. This ticks down every few seconds. Once it hits 0, it's game over. It starts at 5.
* **Heals:** These spawn in random positions. These are green lines, the same size as you, that heal you by one health point to prevent your death.
* **Enemies:** These also spawn in random positions. These are lines, just like heals and the player, but are red, and damage you further than you already have been damaged.
* **Protection:** You get a cooldown after getting hit by an enemy that prevents you from taking enemy damage for a short amount of time, under a second.
* **Scores:**
  * **Main Score:** The score for the game you're currently playing. As of right now, the only way to get it is for 50 points whenever your life ticks down.
  * **Highscore:** Obvious, but the highest score you've ever gotten. It's displayed in-game so you can see your goal to beat.
  * **Totalscore:** This is the collected score of every game you've ever played. This can only be seen at game over.
